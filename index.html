        <h2>The Art of Vietnamese Coffee</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese coffee is more than just a beverage—it's a cultural experience that combines French colonial 
           influence with local traditions. Known for its strong, bold flavor and unique brewing method using a 
           phin filter, Vietnamese coffee has captured the hearts of coffee lovers worldwide.</p>
        
        <p>From the iconic cà phê sữa đá (iced coffee with condensed milk) to the adventurous cà phê trứng 
           (egg coffee), Vietnamese coffee culture offers a rich tapestry of flavors and experiences. The ritual 
           of slowly brewing coffee and watching it drip into a cup is a meditative practice that encourages 
           slowing down in our fast-paced world.</p>
        
        <h3>What Makes Vietnamese Coffee Special?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Robusta Beans:</strong> Vietnamese coffee primarily uses robusta beans, which have a stronger, 
              more bitter taste than arabica.</li>
          <li><strong>Phin Filter:</strong> The traditional metal filter allows for a slow, controlled brew that 
              extracts maximum flavor.</li>
          <li><strong>Condensed Milk:</strong> Sweet condensed milk balances the strong coffee perfectly, creating 
              a harmonious blend.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Culture:</strong> Coffee shops are gathering places where people spend hours chatting, 
              working, or people-watching.</li>
        </ul>
